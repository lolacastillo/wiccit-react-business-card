                <div className=""> Hello World! I'm Larry Castillo. I'm a sci-fi loving developer from
                    Austin, Texas. As denizen of the web I watched the internet develop from a place to share funny cat
                    pictures to watching entire political ideologies unravel in real time on social media platforms. All
                    of this insight has not only informed my aesthetical prowess but it also has informed me how people
                    behave and interact with these technologies that society operates on. Each project I have worked on
                    thus far I have seen to it that any average person could immediately recognize how to navigate
                    through it. I am through and through a front end developer!
